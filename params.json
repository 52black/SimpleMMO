{"name":"SimpleMMO","body":"SimpleMMO\r\n=========\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cnelsonsic/SimpleMMO.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cnelsonsic/SimpleMMO)\r\n\r\nQuick Installation\r\n------------------\r\nYou will need pip to install the requirements, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential\r\nor\r\n\r\n    sudo yum install python-setuptools python-devel gcc\r\n\r\nfollowed by\r\n\r\n    sudo easy_install -U pip\r\n\r\nYou'll need to use pip to install the required python packages:\r\n\r\n    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nSimpleMMO uses supervisor to control its server processes, so you will need to\r\nstart them by running `supervisord` while in the SimpleMMO checkout directory.\r\nYou can use `supervisorctl` to check up on the server processes.\r\n\r\nAlternately, you can deploy without supervisord (not recommended) and manage\r\nprocesses yourself.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can start up the administrative client with\r\n\r\n    python qtclient.py\r\n\r\n\r\nServers\r\n-------\r\n\r\n### AuthServer\r\nThe AuthServer authenticates a client's usernames and passwords.\r\nIts main purpose is to provide the client with a cookie that the other\r\nservers will recognize.\r\nIt also allows a user to look up a list of their characters.\r\n\r\n### CharServer\r\nThe CharServer manages information about Characters.\r\nSpecifically, what zone a character is currently in.\r\nIn the future, this server will probably keep track of a character's statistics,\r\ninventory, and things of that nature.\r\n\r\n### MasterZoneServer\r\nThe MasterZoneServer is responsible for starting up individual zones.\r\nIt also allows a client to look up what URL is associated with a specific zone id.\r\nThe magic is that when it can't find a URL for a zoneid, it starts up a ZoneServer\r\nwhen a zone-id isn't found.\r\n\r\n### ZoneServer\r\nZoneServers get started by the MasterZoneServer automatically.\r\nThe ZoneServers accept requests for a given set of world data.\r\nThey are the actual areas where characters roam about and do game things.\r\nThere are also zone-limited chat and private messages.\r\nThere are global messages but they aren't handled by the ZoneServer.\r\nEach ZoneServer is entirely self-contained and is only concerned with\r\nwhat is contained inside itself.\r\n\r\n#### ScriptServer\r\nScriptServer is a server that runs all the scripts for a Zone.\r\nEach zone should ideally start its own ScriptServer.\r\nContained inside are little Python classes with various event handlers.\r\nSee `games/objects/chicken.py` for an example script.\r\n\r\n#### PhysicsServer\r\nThe PhysicsServer is a bit complex and probably optional in the long run.\r\nIt looks at the database for the zone and simulates all the objects in the scene\r\nas physical, pymunk objects.\r\nThen it updates their positions in-world.\r\nThis is generally just for 'settling' and preventing intersection of physical\r\nobjects.\r\nAgain, this is optional and probably completely vestigial.\r\n\r\nDatabases\r\n---------\r\nSimpleMMO uses a combination of databases to do its job most effectively.\r\n\r\n### SQL\r\nThe bulk of database work is done in an SQL database, you can use MySQL, Postgres,\r\nor even SQLite.\r\nBasically anything that Elixir (and by extension, SQLAlchemy) supports.\r\n\r\n### MongoDB\r\nZones are a little different.\r\nThey use MongoDB for their data storage needs.\r\nIt's fast, but less fault tolerant than the SQL databases.\r\nKeep in mind that when starting for the first time, it may generate a \"prealloc\"\r\nfile that is quite large, on the order of a few gigabytes.\r\nFor most people, this will not be a problem.\r\nHowever on storage-limited systems, this may prove frustrating.\r\n\r\nThe real problem here is that there is a flag for mongod, --noprealloc, which\r\nshould work for its journal files as well, but does not.\r\nSee the bug at: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-2733 for more information.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A simple massively-multiplayer online game server framework.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
